# # Isolating perturbation-induced variations with contrastiveVI
#%% md
# Perturb-seq is a platform for conducting large scale CRISPR-mediated gene perturbation screens in single-cells. A major goal of Perturb-seq experiments is to gain new insights as to gene functions (e.g. pathway membership) and the relationships between different genes. Unfortunately, analyzing the effects of CRISPR perturbation in Perturb-seq experiments can be confounded by sources of variation shared with control cells (e.g. cell-cycle-related variations).
# 
# Here we illustrate how contrastiveVI's explicit deconvolution of shared and perturbed-cell-specific variations can overcome such challenges in the analysis of Perturb-seq data. For this case study, we'll consider data from a large-scale Perturb-seq experiment originally collected in [Norman et al.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax4438) In this study the authors assessed the effects of 284 different CRISPR-mediated perturbations on the growth of K562 cells, where each perturbation induced the overexpression of a single gene or a pair of genes.

# Now let's briefly take a look at our data. In their original work Norman et al. labeled groups of perturbations with similar induced gene programs (e.g. inducing expression of megakaryocyte markers). Thus, we would expect perturbed cells to separate by these program labels (found in `adata.obs['gene_program']`).
# 
# However, contrary to our prior knowledge, we find that perturbed cells do not clearly separate by our gene program labels, and instead separate by confounding variations shared with controls, such as cell cycle phase.

# contrastiveVI explicitly isolates perturbed-cell-specific variations from variations shared with controls by assuming that the data is generated from two sets of latent variables. The first, called the **_background_** variables, are shared across perturbed and control cells. The second, called the **_salient_** variables, are only active in perturbed cells and are fixed at 0 for controls.
# 
# Because contrastiveVI uses a single decoder network to reconstruct all cells, the background variables are naturally encouraged during training to capture patterns shared across all cells, while the salient variables instead pick up the remaining perturbed-cell-specific variations (see the contrastiveVI manuscript for additional details).
